# Project Euler 

Another site for problems to test your algorithm design and C# coding skills. 

1. Create an account on [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/). 
1. Start solving problems, why not start with [problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1). 
    - some are very easy 
    - some are very hard 
    - all are very approachable, "*Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.*" [ref](https://projecteuler.net/about).
    - creating a solution for each problem is probably overkill
    - but as your portfolio grows you might not want all problems solved in one solution 
    - but over time you might find some code and utility functions that you reuse time after time, so having a "tools" library might prove useful 
    - I'll leave that balance for you. 
1. the website just needs the answer not code (like [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)): the honourable thing is to solve it yourself, the cheating way is to copy some else's answer, after all, they are not personalised (unlike [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)).
    - once you solve a problem you can review others' answers 
1. Push all problem solution code to this repo 

Once you're registered you will have access to your [progress](https://projecteuler.net/progress) - including various [levels](https://projecteuler.net/progress;show=levels) and [awards](https://projecteuler.net/progress;show=awards) - perhaps choose an arbitrary award to aim for? 
  - e.g. the [Pi](https://projecteuler.net/award=11) award - exercises 3, 14, 15, 92, 65, 35, 89, 79, 32, 38 and 46 - perhaps?
