# Project Euler 

Another site for problems to test your algorithm design skills. 

1. Create an account on [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/). 
1. Start solving problems, why not start with [problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1). 
    - some are very easy 
    - some are very hard 
    - all are very approachable, "*Each problem has been designed according to a "one-minute rule", which means that although it may take several hours to design a successful algorithm with more difficult problems, an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained on a modestly powered computer in less than one minute.*" [ref](https://projecteuler.net/about).
    - creating a solution for each problem is probably overkill, but as your portfolio grows you might not want all problems solved in one solution - I'll leave that balance for you. 
1. the website just needs the answer not code (like [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)), the honourable thing is to solve it yourself, the cheating way is to copy some else's answer, after all, they are not personalised (unlike [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)).
    - once you solve a problem you can review others' answers 
1. Push all problem solution code to this repo
